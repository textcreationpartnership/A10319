            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <q>Labour not for the meat which periſheth, but for that meat which endureth unto everlaſting life, which the Sonne of man ſhall give unto you: for him hath God the Father ſealed.</q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">M</seg>An is borne to labour, as the ſparkes flye upwards: with the pangs of labour and paine his mother delivers this burthen to the world; and that receives him, not as an indulgent father, but a cenſorious taskemaſter: and, as if he beganne not life<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but an Apprentiſhip, he breakes his faſt with teares, cryes aloud e're dinner, and if he live till night, 'tis much if ſickly grones be not ſome parcell of his breath. Our neceſſities, like niggardly ſtep-dames, locke ſo faſt the cupboords of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhment
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:15986:4"/>
from us, that none but the key of labour can o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen them, this being their peremptory law, <hi>He that will not ioyle, muſt not eat.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But meat being made the end of our toyle, gives more a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lacritie to endure it, and the hopes of that, ſweeten the bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terneſſe of this: let <hi>Apelles</hi> paint the grapes by the boy, and the birds ſhall be more enticed by them, than affrighted by him; thoſe goodly grapes leſſen the ſtature of thoſe Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kims which with-hold them; pictures thoſe Gyants with a milder countenance: and if we heare of a land that flowes with milke and honey, Jordans ſtreame is eaſily ſtrided o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver; if our famiſht appetites heare of meat, they feare no Colloquintida, but now ſhake hands with Labour, are friends with Induſtry, can hardly be compell'd to reſt; they will not liſten to the call of eaſe, their bellies have no eares, till this ſad morſell fill their mouthes: O man of God there is death in the pot, and we have labour'd all this while for meat that periſheth.</p>
            <p>Slacke then your ſailes, ſaith the voyce of my Text; purſue thoſe gilded baits no further, nor pull thoſe fugi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives into your walls which will betray you to the worms: but arme your labour with an holy violence; aſſault the kingdome of heaven; re-enter Paradiſe; the Angell now has ſheath'd his flaming ſword; the tree of Life's unguar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded; <hi>Labour no more for the meat, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The occaſion of theſe words take briefly thus: When<note place="margin">Occaſion<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </note> our Saviour was told of <hi>Herods<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> cruelty againſt Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> the Baptiſt, and of the inquiſition which hee made after himſelfe, as in a doubtfull amazement, fearing him to be <hi>redivivum Iohannem, Iohn</hi> riſen from the dead; and albeit his Omniſcience was conſcious that <hi>Herods</hi> plots, and his determin'd end could not be cotemporaries; nevertheleſſe
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:15986:4"/>
not relying upon the arme of miraculous preſervation, with the wind of this rumor he ſailes over the Sea of Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lilce, on purpoſe, as the three firſt Evangeliſts harmoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly agree, to getout of <hi>Herods</hi> Iuriſdiction: and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though his firſt abode was in the deſart, yet the eager multitude (now greedy in purſuit of miracles) trace him out. Chriſt being found, anſwers their expectation by diſpenſing of his two-fold cures; generally, with his Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine upon their ſoules; and, when particular maladies cryed for ayd, his mercie had miracles for their bodies.</p>
            <p>The day poſts on, and is likely to attaine a period, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he can remember to end his dayes worke of mercie, when his Diſciples (though not more feeling of mans frailty than himſelfe, yet now, perchance, after his length<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Sermon, more ſenſible of their owne) thus admoniſh him. The place is deſart, the Towne's remote, the day'<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> farre ſpent, the people weary; and if they hunger, victuals are not plentifull in the deſart, therefore ſend them away. But Chriſt who had power to broach the rockes and give them drinke, to turne the fruitleſſe deſarts into kit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chins, even repleniſht with Manna for bread, and Quailes for meat, had likewiſe at this time compaſſion enough to fill their bowels<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and the companies being ſat downe (now not more hungring after the meat than the miracle that could provide it) found that two fiſhes, with five loaves and Chriſts bleſſing, were enough to fill five thouſand; and when that was done, (as if each Spawne had now beene haſtned into a perfect Fiſh) to overflow into twelve baskets of fragments.</p>
            <p>As if each word he ſpoke had become a feeding mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell, themſelves might now have witneſſ'd with him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Divell, <hi>that man lives not by bread alone, but by
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:15986:5"/>
every word which proceedeth out of the mouth of God.</hi> That the oyle in the Cruiſe did not faile, and meale in the bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell did not waſt, they had heard; but that the eating ſhould make the remainder exceed its firſt proportion; this, had not ſenſe ſtretch'd it out, might juſtly have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded their faith. Certaine it is by the event of the ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, that this miracle being well digeſted, had a ſtronger operation in them than any that they had ſeene before; and now their pamper'd bellies could prompt them to a devout ſedition, and they durſt, in deſpight of <hi>Caeſars</hi> power, attempt to make Chriſt their King: Their car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall wiſdome eaſily might ſuggeſt him a fit Generall for a conquering army, who could ſo cheaply, and ſo ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly victuall his hungry Campe. But Chriſt, who knew his kingdome of another world, ſlights theſe poore ambitions; nevertheleſſe to declinethe violence of po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pularity, having given his Diſciples the watch-word to ſaile over the Sea, himſelfe glides, firſt from the people, then on the waters after them. Hot was the multitude in their purſuit, and the firſt opportunity imbarque them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves and follow; and being now landed, they find their yeſterdayes ſteward arriv'd before them, which ſtrange celerity, makes their firſt ſalutation this queſtion, <hi>Rabbi, quando huc veniſti?</hi> Maſter, when cameſt thou hither? But Chriſt diſcern'd full well which way their ſtomacke ſtood, that over all this water they did but follow the bait which they yeſterday taſted of, that no other god than their bellies brought them thus farre to ſacrifice; he therefore, neglecting their curious queſtion, ſhapes an anſwer fitter for their affections than their demands, will not tell them when he came, but why themſelves came thither. Verſ. 26, <hi>Not becauſe they ſaw the miracles, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:15986:5"/>
they did eat of the loaves, and were filled.</hi> Thus firſt he daunts them, and what they might thinke hee would ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaud for piety, he condemnes for gluttony; he was able to anatomize their intentions, and found thoſe goads which prick'd them forward to be in their ſtomacke, nor their braine; to fill their bellies with the bread of mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, not their ſoules with the Manna of his Doctrine. And when hee had cool'd their fervency with this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proofe, prepared their appetites with this ſowre repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion, then gives he them my Text as a more whole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome bit to chew on, and thus addreſſes it, <hi>Labour not, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The ſcope of which words import thus much; as if<note place="margin">Scope.</note> he had ſaid, Poore, and beguiled men, whom the gree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy hopes of a fill'd belly could flatter into all this indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry! Was this the cauſe why from towne to deſart, from deſart to ſea, from ſea to land, your untired limbs could follow me? What went you out into the wilderneſſe to ſee? a reed ſhaken with the wind of miracles? or rather whether he could furniſh a table in the deſart? But what went you out into the wilderneſſe to ſee? The ſonne of man cloath'd in the ſoft rayments of mercy and righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe? or rather whether hee could ſatisfie the hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry with bread: But what went you out to ſee? A Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet? or rather a Purveyour? Was all this toyle to ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie your vnderſtandings, or your appetites? to feed your minds or your bellies? I know 'twas the wind of carnall appetite inſpir'd your ſailes this way; it was the ſought-for loaves brought you to this Market.

            <p>My Text, me thinkes, is a map of Paradiſe, and in it<note place="margin">Paral.</note> you ſhall finde both commanded, and forbidden fruit, onely thus they differ; the forbidden fruit there ſtood in the midſt, here in the entry of the garden; the tree of life there not taſted of, is here an offered diſh; the tree of good and evill wholly there forbidden, here diſtinguiſht according to its fruits, the good to be purſued, the other to be neglected; there the fruit it ſelfe forbidden, here onely the labouring for that fruit; there, after the eating labour followed as a curſe, here to reſt from that labour is both a precept, and a bleſſing: thus againe they meet and agree, that both the forbidden meats periſh, the eaters with themſelves, and both deprive the ſoule of the deſired tree of life: So that thus holds both the paralell and the antitheſis: There,</p>

<pb n="10" facs="tcp:15986:8"/>
that many in their practiſe have lived as if this Text gave ſome convenience to a ceſſation from bodily labour for neceſſary food and rayment, (which they call meat that periſheth,) that the practice of many hath laid them open to this accuſation we may collect; becauſe many of the learned Interpretors, and ancient Fathers who have written upon this place, amongſt whom Saint <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> eſpecially, have beene very laborious in in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vection againſt ſuch, and in vindicating this Text from giving any connivence to their Lazineſſe; and therefore to overthrow all ſuch pretences, ſome have diverſly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded and limited the Act, <hi>Labour;</hi> ſome the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Object, <hi>Meat that periſheth;</hi> ſome the Negative par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle. <hi>Hugo Cardinalis</hi> would have to bee meant by the object, <hi>Meat that periſheth, Mala opera,</hi> evill workes, becauſe they are the kirnels and cauſes of all mans peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhing: So that man is not pluckt away from all labour and working by this precept, but onely from the works of darkeneſſe. But thoſe that expound the object more largely, yet underſtand the Act more ſtrictly; that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though labour for bodily meanes be here forbidden, yet not all kind of labour; but as <hi>Rupertus</hi> (after Saint <hi>Baſil,</hi> Saint <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> and others) expounds it, <hi>Nimiam ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licitudinem prohibet, operationem iubet;</hi> 'tis too much ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licitude and anxiety which is forbidden, to labour too eagerly, not to labour at all: for, <hi>Pigritari</hi> (as another has it) idleneſſe is <hi>maximè cibus periens,</hi> the meat that ſooneſt periſheth; the bread of floth is ſooneſt mouldy and corrupt.

Nay, ſome there are who yet ſtraighten the act more narrowly, and will not have this negative precept any generall rule, but limited by the like occaſions as it was here. Now, when the people had opportunity to receive from Chriſt the bread of life, they lingred againe after the five loaves to have more of the meat that periſheth; which when <hi>Muſculus</hi> thought on, he thus inferres, <hi>Non praeſcribit normavi generaliter omnibus, ſed nimium et intempeſtivum ventris ſtudium, ubi occaſio ſpiritualis cibi effertur, abjiciendum eſſe;</hi> That this precept is not intended by Chriſt as a rule, <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, to be at all times obſerved, but here hec teaches that the unſeaſonable care of filling the belly is to bee laid aſide when we are invited to ſpirituall banquets; that <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tha's</hi> incumbrings were therefore culpable, becauſe then ſhee had the choyce of the better part: that the marrying of wives, the buying of oxen, and earthly purchaſes, are onely then to be left aſide, when our ſoules are invited to heavenly feaſts.</p>
            <p>But Cardinall <hi>Tollets</hi> rule, if there were any, takes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way all the difficulty of this place, by limiting the nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive particle: for, ſaith he, <hi>particula, non, ſaepe in Scripturis non negat, ſed ſolicitudinem excludit;</hi> the negative particle does not alwayes deny, but excludes a ſolitarineſſe of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation: as if it had beene ſaid, <hi>Labour,</hi> but not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, or not chiefly for the meat that periſheth, but alſo, &amp;c. And we have, amongſt many others, one pregnant example of this, Ioh. 12. 44. <hi>Hee that beleeveth on mee,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:15986:9"/>
beleeveth not on me, but on him that ſent mee.</hi> Hee that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeveth on me, beleeveth not on me? how can this ſtand together? the rule reconciles it; that is, not onely on me, or not on me chiefly, but on him that ſent mee: and thus it muſt be here expounded, <hi>Labour not,</hi> that is, not onely, or not ſpecially, <hi>for the meat that periſheth, but for, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So that it's plaine, not Labour, but anxiety, unſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable and importunate labour for the meat that pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſheth, is onely here forbidden.</p>
            <p>But imagine awhile, the feet of our induſtry ſhould be fetter'd, the limbs of our diligence ſhould be diſ-join<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and if wee were asked with thoſe in the Goſpell, <hi>Why ſtand you idle all the day?</hi> Wee might anſwer, Not onely becauſe none hath hired us, but becauſe wee are forbidden to labour: What then ſhould we doe for food and rayment? Muſt we ſupinely gape till the ſhowres of providence ſhall raine downe Quailes into our mouthes? Muſt we grovell in the dew for miraculous Mannah? or expect the ſtony rockes to cleave into cups, and preſent themſelves to our thirſty pallats? Shall wee ſit under thoſe Vines and Figge-trees which free Nature hath husbanded, till their voluntary fruit drop into our mouthes? Shall wee, in the conceits of a lawfull ſloth, what the Prophet did out of holy inſpiration, wait for the Ravens to bee our Caterers; expect bowles of mercy from Birds of prey?</p>
            <p>Shall we ſlumber and ſleepe, and fold our hands untill the Handmaids of Nature cloath and get us ready? Shall we ſit with the Lillies in the field, neither labour nor ſpinne, and expect that apparell and ornament ſhall grow upon us? Shall wee glow in the cold, till the pittifull

            </p>
            <p>But not to divorce the Act any longer from the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, that we may better diſcover what it is we muſt not labour for, let me in the ſecond place ſet, for a while, before you the <hi>meat that periſheth.</hi> In addreſſing of which, I entend more clearely to diſcuſſe how farre our la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour may be extended for it, and where againe it muſt retire and breath.</p>
            <p>And firſt, I doubt not but I ſhall befriend your pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence if I paſſe over the divers acceptations of the word <hi>Eſca,</hi> or <hi>Cibus,</hi> Meat, and expound it with the moſt an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient and beſt Interpretours in this one ſignification, for all bodily and outward neceſſities. Nor is the Synechdo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che too violent, which in this one word involves thus much; meat being that which nature has made the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch of all our neceſſities; that if we be not allow'd to labour for meat, there is nothing which may ſet our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry on worke. Aud therefore, no doubt, our Saviour intended to make the negative precept againſt ſolicitous and ſuperfluous labour more Emphaticall, by eccluding in the Object, even what daily is both to be pray'd and labour'd for, <hi>Meat; Labour not for the meat.</hi> For if this injunction had beene more reſtrain'd (as indeed the rules of Interpretation may doe it) and onely had taken from them their ſuperfluity, it might ſeeme to have carried along with it both reproofe and counſell enough. What if hee had allowed them to toyle for their meat; nay, have made that ancient curſe a new Injunction, <hi>In the
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:15986:10"/>
ſweat of thy brow thou ſhalt eat bread!</hi> have compell'd them even to ſweat for their daily bread, but not allow'd them to ſtirre at all for dainties? have forc'd them to eat, even their bread with carefulneſſe, but ſuſter'd them to labour for no other ſawce? What if he had ſaid unto them, Let not your labour perplex it ſelfe for ſuch ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfluity of meat, and pride of rayment, but confine it within the narrow bankes of neceſſity? What exceſſive madneſſe is in that gluttonous care which ſpreads tables not where hunger, but ambition may beſt be ſutisfied? which diſperſes purveyours for the mouth into remoteſt Countries, that the wanton pallat may feed on what the eye till then ne're ſaw? Spare your ſuperfluous paines in fetching in the whole brood of nature to make one meale, one bait for gluttony: Tell mee, Could not the five loaves upon the homely graſſe refreſh your hungry appetites, as well as all thoſe glutting morſels ſpread, in ſo proud a method, upon your finer linnen and purples? cannot the ſtomacke fill, but when the eye is dazled? nor meat digeſt, except received from the richeſt mettals? Is not gluttony at eaſe but in a wardrobe? nor Iunkets ſweet but ſerv'd in Iewels? If labour ſhould be allow'd for theſe, time has not howres enough to diſpatch it. Nor muſt this Labour bee leſſe reſtrained from other ſuper<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fluities; though rayment be within its reach, yet pride is farre too high for it; leiſure may be allow'd to cloath, when it cannot to adorne. The ſheepe, that's neare at hand, gives us ſhelter enough from the cold, why ſhould we hunt after more coſtly furres and wrappings? Is the skinne of the beaſt too cheape, that the bowels of worms muſt be wrought into clothing? Natures helpe is a ſhorter cut: Muſt you ſend for apparell to the utmoſt
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:15986:11"/>
bounds of the earth before you can be readie: muſt all the creatures lend their ayd to dreſſe one man? and is he not hanſome til anticke beaſts have given him a ſhape? muſt a Iury of Trades be buſied to verdict him readie? and every diſorder'd haire bee allow'd a time for refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation? Certainly, if we may labour for this out-ſide perfection, then no labour is forbidden. Againe, had it not likewiſe beene a checke to have forbidden their exceſſive labour and toyle in the rearing up of their am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitious Babels, as if they meant to goe to heaven by the ſtaires of their houſes; or rather to fetch downe heaven thither, and ſo make them their everlaſting habitations; to make each angle of their dwellings like the poliſhed corners of the Temple, and every ſtone a Statue; to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grave to poſteritie the ſtories of their vanted pedigree, and epitomize the hyſtorie of the world in their ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluous carvings; to fill each chamber as a wardrobe, and ſtuffe every roome with the treaſures of the Eaſt; to extend their walls to an admired vaſtneſſe, and give their private manſions capacitie for the traines of Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces! If labour for theſe extremities of exceſſe had one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly beene forbidden, the wonder would not have beene great. Therefore, more ſtrictly to forbid ſuperfluities, in my Text, not onely vanities, but decencies; not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſurfetting, but feeding; not onely exceſſe of meat, but even meat it ſelfe ſeemes to be forbidden to made the Object of our Labour, <hi>Labour not for the meat, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But to continue to ſhew the force of the negative pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept as it is joyn'd with the Object <hi>Meat,</hi> (beſides ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluous Labour) in this word, <hi>Labour,</hi> here are theſe two kinds of it forbidden: <hi>Labour importunus</hi> (or <hi>importuna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi>) and <hi>non opportunus.</hi> The conjugates of the firſt word
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:15986:11"/>
may beare both <hi>Importunate,</hi> and <hi>Importune Labour;</hi> the firſt denotes an unlawfulneſſe in the manner of the Act; the ſecond in the circumſtance of time; the firſt is labour too earneſt, too ſollicitous; the ſecond is labour out of its due time, unſeaſonable. And if we attend to the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion of our Saviours delivery of theſe words of my Text (namely, when the people preſſed after him, both with violence, and that likewiſe for bodily food, when they had opportunity to ſeeke and obtaine the food of their ſoules) thus farre, and thus onely ſhall we perceive his command to be negatively extended.</p>
            <p>Firſt then, Labour not for outward things; that is, with immoderate labour. <hi>Non ne habeat praecipit ſed ne ſolicitus habeat; non ne in domum ſed ne in animum intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittat:</hi> Not but that we may have theſe outward ſupple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, but not with ſolicitude; we may lodge them in our houſes, but not our hearts: we may buy them for our ſelves, but we muſt not ſell our ſelves to them. Let not the full bent of your endevours ſtand that way; hurry not your ſelves along with the eagertide of prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipitation, but let moderation ſtand at the ſterne, and hold the reines of your induſtry; and let the feet of your af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections goe, but not runne after this periſhing meat: Let not the ſtormes of violence, but the milder blaſts of indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferencie waft your ſailes through theſe ſtraights of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane wants; take not the wings of Vultures to fetch in meat as prey, nor eat the bread of violence, but ſeeke it daily at the hands of Providence. The Lions lacke and ſuffer hunger, notwithſtanding all their ravening and roaring, whereas the meeker brood of nature meet with a ſhepheard that brings it to their mouthes. The wild and ſavage beaſts ramble for their food in the deſart,
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:15986:12"/>
whereas the tame ones obtaine the mercie of mans fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile habitations: the vehement and ſturdy winds hold up and drive away the raine, the ſofter gales moyſten the earth with fruitfull ſhowres. We may herein take ſome reſemblance from God himſelfe, and ſeeke his bleſſings in ſo calme a way as he declares himſelfe to give them: Not, as he brought the Locuſts, by ſome mighty blu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtring wind, which might rend the rockes of barrenneſſe; not by plowing up our ground with prodigious earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quakes; not by burning up the tares and brambles with ſome impetuous fire, but by the ſtill and ſweet voyce and ayd of his providence: The kingdomes of this world are not to bee taken by violence; nay, wee muſt not ſnatch, but pray for daily bread: Let not man aſſault his earthly affairs with all the engines of his wit and ſtrength, but rather winne them by wary compoſition: Let not his hot purſuit broyle him in an Aegyptian furnace to purchaſe bricke and ſtone, the baſe materials of an earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Babell: Let him indeed labour to the exerciſing of his limbs, not the cracking of his ſinewes, where anxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety muſt needs accompany Labour, <hi>Labour not for the meat, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, as this Labour muſt not be with importu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, ſo neither muſt it be againſt opportunity; that is, though we be allow'd to labour for periſhing meat, yet neither chiefly for that, nor unſeaſonably, when wee ſhould labour for that other which periſheth not. That indeed of the Moraliſt is as true as plauſible, <hi>Ad virtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem tendenti etiam fortunae indulgentia eſt neceſſaria, &amp;c.</hi> The Indulgence of outward ſuſtenance is neceſſary, whilſt yet the ſoule<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> wraſtles with the infirmities of a fainting body, whilſt it ſtrives to untye this knot of fleſh,
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:15986:12"/>
and breake through all the chaines of mortality; but yet ſo, that there muſt be a ſubordination both in place and time, betwixt the fading and the permanent; and to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow thoſe howres on that which are due to this, were to loſe both. Seaſon and time are of ſuch powerfull con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence, that the neglect of them turnes even ſweet into ſowre, good into evill; makes thoſe actions which in themſelves are lawfull, to be deſpis'd and ſinfull: <hi>They wait upon thee,</hi> ſaith the Pſalmiſt, <hi>and thou giveſt them their meat in due ſeaſon:</hi> Even meat, out of ſeaſon, is the bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then, not the food of the ſtomacke; to labour therefore for it out of ſeaſon, were like Aſſes to couch under a bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then which no neceſſity impoſes on us; nay, which ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily diſeaſes us. <hi>Labour</hi> out of ſeaſon could ne're ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act its wages: the ſeed that's ſowne before, or when the time of ſowing's paſt, never bleſt the ſower with maturi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, 'tis it wherewith the mower filleth not his handfull, nor he that bindeth ſheaves his boſome: he that ſo ſowes that he may reape, makes the ſeaſon of ſowing the chiefe pillar of his hopes of reaping.</p>
            <p>The ſumme then is this, If you have howres to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow on moderate labour for meat and outward neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, yet rob not the ſoules opportunities to allow the body time; ſlacke not that taske which God has com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to obey the belly; loſe not that time, nor hide in the napkin of gluttony, which, well employ'd, may gaine the Talent of Eternity: Beleeve me, 'tis the height of ſacrilege to ſteale time from the Sanctuary; and houres which ſhould ſerve at the Altar, ſacrificed to buſineſſe, makes our affaires our Idols. The howres of Devotion runne in their owne conſtant revolution, nor muſt wee count it arbitrary to prorogue them. The Sabbaths of
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:15986:13"/>
grace ſtand in their owne unalterable Kallenders, nor is it mans power to make the ſoules feaſts moveable; to be ſerving ourſelves when we ſhould be ſerving of God, is to turne day into night, to make the armour of God a worke of darkneſſe.</p>
            <p>The Sunne and Starres, the worlds great Clocks and and witneſſes of time, have taught our Dials to meaſure out God's by inches, and mans by ells; hee that would pilfer from that, is too ingratefull to live a ſpanne of life. Shall we doubt to give him his fulneſſe of time, who hath both inveſted us with time, and made us capable of Eternity? When hee's leſſoning our ſoules, ſhall we be crambing our bodies? or rather leave the beſt Junkets of the body, to gaine one morſell for the ſoule. Whilſt that is feeding on the bread of Life, <hi>Labour not for the meat that periſheth.</hi> And this is both the Specification of the Object, Periſhing Meat; and the reaſon inforcing this negative precept, why we muſt not labour for it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it periſheth.</p>
            <p>But before we enter into this, were it no tworth the labor to enquire why our meat ſhould be called <hi>Periſhing?</hi> Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly, as it is mans meat, his food and ſuſtenance, 'tis that <hi>commune vinculum,</hi> which knits and marries the ſoule to the body; ſhall it be then the cauſe of their divorce? When man periſheth, ſurfetting indeed may be a cauſe; but meat ſeemes to be a Catholique Antidote againſt all malignant poyſons and enemies of natures continuance. Is it not Meat which armes our periſhing fleſh againſt the powers of death, and diſpatches new ſupplies to nature, when the former ſpirits beginne to faile? Does not the tender ſuckling ſeeme apprehenſive of this truth, which knowes the dugge that feeds it, before the mother that
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:15986:13"/>
brought it forth? Being cannot continue without ſuſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance; and ſhall the Author of our continuance be like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe the cauſe of our periſhing? Shall that which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larges the epitomy of infancy, and ſets it forth into thoſe early editions of growth and ſtature; that which ſpins the thread of life to ſuch a length be likewiſe the knife to cut it off? If honey be meat, dip but the tip of <hi>Ionathans</hi> rod; and beſides the continuance of life, it may adde a victorious courage to his limbs. Drinke, taken but from the brooke in the way, may make the languiſhing ſoule lift up his head: Even poyſon, having taken acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance with the pallat of Mithridate, as meat, could now ſooner nouriſh than deſtroy. The flying ſpirits with the taſt of meat recoyle to their tabernacle; and famiſht bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, even dropping into their earthly principles, receive this doome from food, Returne ye ſonnes of <hi>Adam:</hi> then how can meat be periſhing? To make meat peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhing, were to metamorphiſe bread into ſtones, fiſhes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Scorpious, honey into gall, even food into poyſon: how then can meat be periſhing? <hi>Are not two Sparrowes ſold for a farthing?</hi> and ſhall we buy our owne deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and ſet a price on thoſe petulant creatures that come within us to undoe us? <hi>Ariſe, Peter, kill and eat,</hi> were the words of the viſion; but, if this were true, theſe words might well have follow'd; ſuch creatures as will riſe in thy ſtomacke, kill, and devoure thy ſelfe. 'Tis true indeed, our fathers eat Mannah in the wilderneſſe, and are dead, and periſht, but was the Mannah the cauſe of their periſhing? And have wee not read how <hi>David</hi> when he was an hungred went in and eat the Shew-bread, and regaind more vigour, and was further from periſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by the eating of it. <hi>Man lives not by bread alone,</hi>
               <pb n="22" facs="tcp:15986:14"/>
ſaith our Saviour: whence we may gather, that bread is a partiall cauſe of his life; ſhall we then thinke, that lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle leaven unleavens mans whole lumpe? that thoſe treacherous graines prove Amalekites, and Iebuſites, thornes in our eyes, and prickes in our ſides, or ſeed us into putrifaction? How then muſt we doe to joyne this epithite of periſhing, with meat? Nevertheleſſe, if we attend, the doubt will not be very intricate, why our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour ſhould make uſe both of the metaphor of meat, and the ſpecification, periſhing; the former both befit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the preſent occaſion, meat being that which they now ſought for, &amp; likewiſe moſt able to beare the whole latitude of the ſignification for all outward neceſſities: and for the latter, although as 'tis food it cannot be ſaid to be cauſally periſhing, yet in regard of its ſubſtance, it is both periſhing in it ſelfe, and likewiſe by accident proves as commonly the cauſe of mans periſhing as of his ſuſtenance. Ever ſince the eating of that forbidden fruit, a curſe having cloven to our meats; and as Gods grace makes them nouriſhable, ſo that primitive maledi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction makes them periſhable; as they proved ſowre grapes to our firſt parents, ſo they have continued to ſet our teeth on edge, and ſinne neceſſarily accompanying their enjoyment, corruption and death the ſting of ſinne, muſt needs enſue: and therefore we may well proſecute the ſpecification as a reaſon to flye the object, and ſo to inforce the negative Precept, <hi>Labour not for the meat which periſheth;</hi> or as now I am to handle it in <hi>genere cauſae,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it periſheth.</p>
            <p>For why ſhould wee ſtruggle and ſtrive to attaine that which being attain'd will not abide the uſe. So childiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to ſpend our breath for bubbles, and hunger for meat
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:15986:14"/>
which cannot ſtay to ſatisfie: Shall we, like fooliſh Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants, compaſſe ſea and land for a purchaſe which will not laſt the bringing home? Shall our paines reape the ſooneſt decaying fruit? or ſhall our deſires long for that which is ſhorteſt of continuance? Doe we not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to inveſt our bodies with rayment of the longeſt weare? and marke the higheſt prized ſtuſtes with ſuch lying names as may boaſt of their durable continuance? Is it not a perpetuity which Nature aymes at? and has ſhe not cloth'd the weeds, and mildeſt of her creatures with moſt periſhing garments? The vaniſhing ſmoake and vapours, the languiſhing clouds which roule them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves into their owne haſty conſumptions, the ſhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lived meteors, and all the children of the melting ayre, fill the ſame day in their Kalender with their birth and death; whereas the purer heavens involve themſelves in their endleſſe orbs; the lively Sunne and Stars, thoſe Iewels of Natures garment, ſhine in an everlaſting con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy of glory; nor can all the Arithmeticke of time ſubtract from their native vigour, but each new day ſends them forth as Gyants ready to runne their courſe. Why then is it the more periſhing part of nature which wee ayme at, and build our ſenſes on the ſlippery ſands, when there are rockes ſo neare? Amidſt an whole Paradiſe of fruit, onely the tree of Life is never taſted<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Wee ſowe within our ſelves the ſeed of our owne corruption, and chooſe ſuch meats for the belly as will make God de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy both it and them; our meat is receiv'd into us as fiery hulks into a Navy, which ruine themſelves and thoſe that admit them. <hi>Accepimus peritura perituri,</hi> mortals feed on mortals; nor can Natures ſalt turne ſeaſon into Eternity, preſerve either the eaten or the eaters fleſh
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:15986:15"/>
from corruption. Goe now, vaine <hi>Paracelſian,</hi> and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract for men the quinteſſence, nay, the ſoules of periſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing beaſts, and yet ſhall man be like the beaſt that peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſheth. Let that luxurious heathen feed his fiſhes with the fleſh of men, that they againe may feed mans fleſh: let all the troops and heards of nature lay downe their life at his kitching doore, and ſacrifice their fatneſſe for his health, yet ſhall not thouſands of Rams, nor ten thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand of Oxen, the blood of Buls, nor the Sheepe on a thouſand mountaines, with all their lives, redeeme one day of his. <hi>Si non perit et expelltur hic cibus,</hi> ſaith Saint <hi>Baſil, perimus nos citius.</hi> If the meat wee take in ſhould not periſh and corrupt by our concoction, our ſelves muſt periſh more ſpeedily. <hi>Labour not then for the meat that periſheth;</hi> if it be for no other reaſon, yet becauſe it pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſheth.</p>
            <p>But enough of that meat, that was the firſt, but now there remaines a ſecond courſe, <hi>Everlaſting Life;</hi> for which, I may preſume, every religious appetite does hunger. In that other indeed are many varieties, here but one diſh; but yet like the Mannah, able to repreſent (nay be) to the pallat whatſoever the ſoule ſhall luſt for. But before we admit you to this, we muſt needs examine, a while, how you have behaved your ſelves with that, and whether your ſtomacke be not too full with it. For who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever eateth the meat, and drinketh the drinke, even that periſheth, unworthily, is in great danger to be denyed this other. To make therefore our application more metho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicall, we muſt needs thus addreſſe our cenſure; firſt, on them who ſinne againſt the Negative, by not labouring at all; and ſecondly, on thoſe who entrench too farre upon the Affirmative, in labouring too much; and that
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:15986:15"/>
with their eyes and cares fixt upon this Object, <hi>Meat,</hi> nay and under this ſpecification of periſhing meat.</p>
            <p>And firſt, me thinkes, its even neceſſary to invocate the whole quire of holy Prophets, Apoſtles, Fathers and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretors, againe to cleare this parcell of our Saviours precept, <hi>Labour not,</hi> from warranting this our ſpreading idleneſſe: <hi>Labour not?</hi> why the whole world is a gaming, or a ſleeping, and even Saint <hi>Paul</hi> in the pulpit were not able to waken their drowſie conſciences, having firſt bin lull'd by this ſoft voyce of <hi>Labour not.</hi> Why, 't has given the truanting world a deſired play-day, 't has fetch't them from the Brick-kilnes of Aegypt, and now like vagrants in the deſart, providence owes them a ſuſtenance; and you ſhall find all their Tribes hanging this motto at their Eſcutchions, <hi>Labour not.</hi> You ſhall obſerve them to out-Epicure the foole in the Goſpell, and before they have their garners fill'd, or laid up treaſures for many yeares, to ſing their requiems, <hi>Eat, and drinke, and take thine eaſe;</hi> this precept is their happy portion, <hi>Labour not.</hi> So that certainely if this precept were preſented to the ſuffra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of men to confirme it as a law, and to ſet a penalty on their heads that needs would labor, ſuch Courts of Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure would ſcarcely in an age find one offender, but eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one would moſt zealouſly endevour to keepe his hands from labour.</p>
            <p>And I am afraid, our invection may here be as perti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent, as in any Citty of the world, this being an hive which ſwarmes with innumerable drones, which come hither to ſucke the honey and fatneſſe of the land, which in this place flowes; and all they labour for, is to thruſt their ſtings into the more thriving and laborious ſort. It is farre beyond my young diſcovery, and (I thanke God)
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:15986:16"/>
my experience in evill, to find out the innumerable waies which idleneſſe has here invented to maintaine it ſelfe; but my informations are infallible, that ſloth hath now, to ſupport it ſelfe, ſet up, if not a Trade, yet a myſterie; and it wil one day be a wonder that it's banner is not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>play'd with the ſolemnity of the reſt; for, I am ſure that all your twelve have not a more numerous company than that of idleneſſe.</p>
            <p>And the Maſters, or firſt of theſe idle companions are thoſe who may well be accounted a Company by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; for they are ſuch whom the world, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, has called <hi>Good Companions.</hi> Good Companions? good for what? to ſuffocate the time with ſmoke and vapours, to drownd the drying cares with a deluge of drinke? the tedious time afflicts and perſecutes them, they cannot be rid of it till ſuch as theſe ſhall drive it away. This indeed is the onely company which (as an Idoll) ſet up Idle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and profeſſe it; and ſpend their whole eſtate on purpoſe to ſpend the time: and of precious howres (of which onely a covetouſneſſe is lawfull) they are moſt deſperately prodigall: And thoſe dayes workes they thinke the beſt imploy'd, whereon they have, without wearineſſe, done nothing: Except this be to labour, with the <hi>Belides</hi> in hell, ever to be filling <hi>Danaidum dolium,</hi> bottomleſſe veſſels; ever to bee meaſuring in drinke at their mouthes by whole ſaile, and ſtill retailing of it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine by vomiting: If this be to labour, to have the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor worke and be more buſie in their brains, than them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves are in their Shops and affaires! If this be to labour to ſwill their lungs, till they ſoake them to ſpunges, to make their veynes which ſhould adminiſter blood and ſpirits, become hydropicall, baſe and abject Water-bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers!
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:15986:16"/>
If this be to labour, to invent ſcurrilous libels, and with the dregs of wit, and their liquor, beſpot their appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell, and temperate neighbors. If this be to labour, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagate unworthy quarrels, to ſeeke for wounds without a cauſe, to fluſh their complexion to the drunkards ruby, to make this bluſh on their face like the buſh at the doore, a ſigne that good wine uſually dwels there, if all this be to labour, then theſe are never idle. Certainly, all their toyle might ſeeme to be to build Caſtles of ſmoke in the ayre, they may be ſaid to dwell in the middle region, amongſt ſmoke and moiſter vapors, and themſelves commonly pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh as meteors. Nay, why may we not ſay that they dwell in our American Iles, whither they have tranſplanted their affections, and as others have gone from amongſt us (God knowes upon what grounds) to purchaſe that earth; ſo theſe ſend to purchaſe the baſeſt part of that earth, the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry weeds of it, nay and the baſeſt part of that weed, the very ſmoke that ariſes from it.</p>
            <p>Nor is this all, but a ſecond ſinne of Idleneſſe, namely Wantonneſſe, is neceſſarily ſtumbled on by this; for the Poets, no queſtion, were not leſſe ſignificant than witty, who alwayes made the Satyrs attendants on <hi>Bacchus,</hi> laſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>civiouſneſſe and petulancy, being the birth of their frothy cups, as <hi>Venus</hi> was fain'd of the froth of the Sea; and thoſe who ſpend their time and themſelves on this vice, I dare ſay are idely given, and you may be ſure they <hi>labour not;</hi> for Labour is the onely antidote againſt the poyſons of luſt; and therefore this Cities providence was very ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table, to quell luſt with a Bridewell, to worke; and to cenſure whoriſhneſſe with the embleme of labor, the Cart; and were theſe with greter ſeverity required at the hands and laid upon the ſhoulders of more of theſe wantons,
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:15986:17"/>
they would quickly drive luſt out of their bones.</p>
            <p>But thirdly, there are another ſort who come more ſeldome within the liſts of labour than theſe, and thoſe are our Common gameſters, whoſe every dayes worke is to have playd all the day; this ſeemes to bee their vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation; and truly they are more diligent in it than any. And as if they had learnt of thoſe Idolaters in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, that place ſeemes to be but a prolepſis of their cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome, <hi>the people ſate downe to eat and drinke, and roſe up to play;</hi> the price, and place, and howres of gaming ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding in their ordinary courſes, as well as of eating and drinking. Tis ſtrange to ſee that theſe unbuſied per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons can continue in this playing idleneſſe till it become atoyle, and thus exerciſed, can confound the day and the night, make the evening with the two mornings but their Naturall day! Shuffle off the revolutions of time without taking any notice, indure the courſe of the Sunne, the ſucceſſion of the Moone and Starres, as if they were Candles for them to play by; and turne that moſt godly counſell of the Apoſtle, of watching and praying, into a moſt Divelliſh Paranomaſie of watching and playing.</p>
            <p>Certainely, theſe are thoſe terrours of the night, who when they proſper not in their hazards, are ready to fetch up all the curſes can be invented, nay to hale the divels themſelves from hell into their luckeleſſe loſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes: and if <hi>Iudas</hi> betrayed our Saviour for thirty peeces of ſilver, theſe are ready to open his wounds with oaths, and fetch out his blood againe at the loſſe of but one.</p>
            <p>And what's the reaſon of all this, but, beſides the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe of time ſpent at it, their very adventures fall deepe into their eſtates; and the croſſe winds of fortune makes
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:15986:17"/>
their goods meet with a ſhipwracke, though farre from the Sea; and all their ſubſtance may even in a parlour ſinke and be gone, and themſelves and patrimony with one diſmall throw quite overthrowne, when at laſt they finde that they have caſt away money, time, and grace, and have met with robbers, as <hi>Pharaoh</hi> did with Frogges at their very chambers. For now there are ſprung up a wiſer generation in this kinde, who have the Art to coy the fonder ſort into their nets, who have now reduced gaming to a Science, if not more thriving, yet more getting than any of the Liberall ones: Birds of prey who live by the fruits of other mens labours; Eagles which flye about the ſlothfull carkaſſes; and what thoſe have ſcarcely obtain'd in a yeare by working, theſe gaine from them in one howre of playing: they ſtay till, like Spunges, they have ſuck'd in the moyſture of many yeares gaines, and then they ſqueeze them in a moment, and make the very glea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of <hi>Ephralm,</hi> better than the vintage of <hi>Abiezer.</hi> Certainely their limitago were fallen to them in a good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ground (where ſo ſmall a part of an Aker is ſo fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and yeelding) and they might terme it, not the lot of their inheritance, but their inheritance of the Lot, if this wheele of Fortune could be held from turning; if God would give them grace to keepe, what the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vell has given them cunning to get; but commonly as they are ſhuffled together with the Knaves, and cut off with the ſcouring of the world, ſo you ſhall heare them ratling the bones, till their owne are ready to rattle in their skinne; and at laſt become materials for Dice, that which made them living, being now made of them being dead: But to reforme theſe, were to undoe an
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:15986:18"/>
army of Tapſters, and to make waſte the moſt goodly and fruitfull ground in all your Citie, the Bowle-allies and Dice-houſes, which are ſo much the more fruitfull, becauſe theſe weeds are ſuffered even to grow and flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh there to rankneſſe.</p>
            <p>But I will not particularize in more that labour not; thoſe that I have already named had the ring, and you may finde moſt of the reſt dancing within it; tis ſtrange to obſerve, how many are buſie, but for an af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-idleneſſe, and what care they take, that they may take none: tis not the love of labour ſets any on worke, but the Piſmire's providence; indure't in Summer, leſt they ſhould ſuffer't in winter; or elſe employ them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in ſuch as the Moraliſt calls <hi>deſidioſanegotia,</hi> ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious trifles; like children beſmeare themſelves for toyes, otherwiſe <hi>labour not.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But ſecondly, as theſe may offend in the Negative, ſo many there are which treſpaſſe upon the Affirmative force of this precept, namely, in labouring too much, and that in theſe three reſpects, either in <hi>ſupervacuis, importunis,</hi> or <hi>immoderatis laboribus:</hi> In labour that is ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſuperfluous, unſeaſonable, or immoderat; all which (by the antitheſis of the cenſure with the theſis which lay in the parts) fall directly within the cenſure of this negative precept.</p>
            <p>Firſt then, I doubt, we ſhall ſpye the moſt of thoſe which keepe ſuch a buſtling in the world, as if't were they tooke all the paines, to doe it for ſinfull and ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfluous Objects; and if they ſometimes caſt but a looke or a thought after righteouſneſſe, yet are they frequent workers of iniquitie; purſue that but with the eye, this with the hand and induſtrie.

            <p>Does not ſuperfluitie daily cover our Tables? and meats which muſt make wanton as well as ſtrong, fill up our ſtomacks? Are not thoſe the feaſts of niggards, where Luxury is not Caterer? and our meetings too homely and diſordered, if riot be not the Steward? Ancient gluttony was then at the height, when Iunkets of the Land could bee fed on at Sea, and the Sea ſend her varieties to the Land for a requitall; but now both Sea, Earth, and Ayre, muſt concentour at one Table, as if <hi>Noah</hi> from hence were to fill his Arke with all manner of Creatures; or as if their Table<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clothes muſt imitate Saint <hi>Peters</hi> ſheet, repreſent the Species of all Creatures, cleane and uncleane: nay, as if their very ſtomackes were to be <hi>Noahs</hi> Arke, where thoſe Creatures muſt not be preſerved from, but pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh'd with a deluge of drinke which followes after; and he a very juſt and upright man that can bee ſaved from it.

And they muſt needs conclude, that man who feeds on them, and is nouriſh'd by them, is the moſt various and devouring monſter of them all. How ſtrange it is that ſo much of our labour and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence ſhould now belong to the bellie, that wit and art ſhould keepe Schoole in the Kitching, and turne profeſſors of Cookery; that the invention of provoking Sauces ſhould be their Lectures and Critticiſmes, that the belly ſhould have ſo good capacitie; and the pallat, though ſo much cloy'd and dull'd, ſhould attaine ſuch ingenuitie.</p>
            <p>That a man ſhould turne his friends to Cannibals, and invite them to devoure his owne ſubſtance, and eat him out of houſe and harbour, that he ſhould purſe up ſo much of his revenues in his belly, and make a feaſt at the departure of his patrimony; that he ſhould labour and travell, and be bigge with ſuperfluity, and not deliver'd of it but with his eſtate<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that the Apoſtles penalty ſhould be eluded, <hi>He that will not labour, let him not eat,</hi> for thoſe have now the beſt ſtomacks, and hee that labours leaſt, eats moſt.</p>

Whoſe bodies are their golden Calfes, and whatſoever time they can ſpare from idleneſſe and gluttony, is altogether ſacrificed to the dreſſing of this Idoll.</p>
            <p>Thus might we finde ſuperfluous labour in the am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitious yawning after outward dignitie and honour, whileſt we labour to make worth the gift of pedigree, and read deſerts written in Eſcutcheons; whileſt ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour is raked from the graves of our parents, and the monuments of their vertues, muſt be the pillars to up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold our crazy fame, whileſt the Armes of their Nobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie is, indeed, the device of our owne; and the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blemes of theirs, the life of ours. Whileſt we beguile poſterity with uſurped motto's, and would make them beleeve that to have beene the pencill of vertue, which was but the painters. Fond ambition, that ſtruggles to be eternall in a ſtone, and thinkes that a painted Sepul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher can dawbe over, or bury committed faults; thy memory ſhall rot before<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> thy monuments, and Satyri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call infamy ſhall hale thy vices to a reſurrection before thy bodies.</p>
            <p>Is it not ſuperfluous to have your houſes that muſt even over<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>top the Churches, as if they were their o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver-ſeers; when, indeed, they have beene their under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miners: Who will not grieve at that irreligious and ſcandalous ſuperfluitie, to ſee, where their manſions

            <p>Laſtly, can wee finde no ſuperfluous labour for wealth and riches? Are you all content with a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petency? Is a <hi>viaticum</hi> enough to carry you through the journey of this lifes pilgrimage? or doe you ſeeke for unneceſſary baggage and burdens to retardate your ſpeed? Why then doe thoſe winged veſſels cut the water and ayre, and viſit Nations as diſtant in language as ſcituation? to fetch neceſſities or ſuperfluities, pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſes ſuitable to your wants or deſires? Could wee ever know the abode of a man that was rich enough, and thought ſo himſelfe, or was there not ſtill in his ayme ſome further purchaſe? Will a mad man beleeve he is mad? or was ſuperfluity ever accounted ſuperflu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous by him that had it? Looke into your houſes, where if ſeelings be an ornament, what are ſcrupulous car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vings? Are not hangings wrought by the tedious nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle, and not longer in working than in bringing home, neare of kinne to ſuperfluity? Has not wealth turvia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted into coſtly inventions, and made wood and ſtone which homely Nature lent you, proud of their gilded clothing, and even ready to ſhrinke under the burthen of their ſuperfluous trappings? 'Twere an homely com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint to ſay that glaſſe is become Chryſtall; have you not veſſels whoſe very fragility raiſes the price even danger, whereas it ſhould make more cheap, with thoſe wantons of wealth makes the inſtruments of oſtentation

more deare. Has not the whole world help'd you to furniſh one houſe, and the Sea lent ſuch Jewels as may weigh downe the ranſome of many of your brethrens lives and eſtates? What need we peepe into their Clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſets? It would dazle your eyes to ſee how they make each Chamber <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">

            <p>But this ſuperfluity might ſeemeto be inveigh'd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt by the envy of poverty, that, like the Fox in the Fable we ſpeake againſt grapes we cannot reach; if that labour that attaines it were but ſeaſonable, if it flowed within the bankes of juſt moderation: But if it were ſo, what meanes the bleating and bellowing, the noyſe and clamor, the cry which goes along with us in ſcenting out theſe periſhing objects, when as if without ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluities we were famiſh'd; we aske them with the voice of barren <hi>Rachell,</hi> Give me ſuperfluities or elſe I dye; and breake through tho ſtone-walls of coſt and difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, not for hunger, but wantonneſſe; meat, but dainties! when we eat not onely what the ſweat of the brow, but what's purchas'd with the price of blood; when with ſtomackefull children we bawle for Rattles, nor can have the cry of our labours appeas'd, till our humour's fulfilld.</p>
            <p>Doe they not digge their Iewels from rockes of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damants, and ſcrew their gold from the center, whereas the earth has offer'd our more eaſie paines daily bread, and all things neceſſary; ſhe has drown'd and hid thoſe noxious mettals, and laid her whole weight upon them; how violent then is that labor which rends up the bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els

of our common mother, for droſſe and dung, haling up Iron from the ſame obſcurity with gold and ſilver, that neither<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the Inſtruments nor the price of our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction may be denyed our ſuperfluous toyling.</p>
            <p>Climbs not Ambition up an Icy mountaine? Are not all lower degrees diſeaſes to it? from which when 'tis cured, is it not over-toyled with danger of relapſe? How in its aſcent it wraſtles with each rougher knot to conquer its ſupportance! what panting, what brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, what courting the ſlippery holds! does it not breake and corrupt its wayes over thoſe Alpes, as <hi>Han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nibal</hi> did with Vinegar? with the ſowre and ſmart of all their Induſtry; mounts the ſteps by a motion not more tedious and violent than contrary to nature, though perchance, when al is done, with one juſt fal, breaks both the backe, the eſtate, the credit, and the heart of him that thus attaines it?</p>
            <p>But thirdly, Is this labour in ſeaſons alwayes beſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming it? I feare me, as it is importunate and inſtant, ſo likewiſe that it is both in ſeaſon and out of ſeaſon; and what our Saviour would have his Diſciples deprecate, as likely to prove a greater augmentation to their affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, namely that their flight might not happen in the winter, nor on the Sabbath day; the hot purſuit of theſe can feele no winter, nor their cold devotions acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge any Sabbath day, but all ſeaſons muſt be their har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſt, and they not onely plucke, but reape their eares of corne on the Sabbath day, though it turne their carnall eares from hearing the word of God.</p>
            <p>And thus like ingratefull theeves that rob their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefactors, when God beſtowes bleſſings on them, they ſteale time from God to fetch them home: and becauſe
